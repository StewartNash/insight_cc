This is my second commit. Unfortunately, I only have two days to work on the project, because I overlooked the project email in my inbox somehow. I was able to work Friday and turned in a preliminary project. I was given an extension until Monday, but was not able to work over the weekend. So I had Friday and Monday to finish the project.

I fixed errors caused by editing in Windows. I still have to do additional debugging.
