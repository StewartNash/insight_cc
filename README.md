# insight_cc

Unfortunately, I only had two days to work on the project (Friday and Monday). However, it was successfully completed.

Commit 1 (July 10) - Initial project without debugging. 

Commit 2 (July 13) - Second commit fixed errors introduced in formatting by Windows. 

Commit 3 (July 13) - Debugged project and fixed error in median. Median is per tweet and not out of all tweets.
